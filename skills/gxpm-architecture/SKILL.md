# Improve Codebase Architecture

Surface architectural friction and propose **deepening opportunities** — refactors that turn shallow modules into deep ones. The aim is testability and AI-navigability.

## 入口条件

Load this skill when you see:
- User asks to "improve architecture", "refactor", "make this more testable", or "reduce coupling".
- A diagnosis surfaces an architectural root cause (tight coupling, shallow modules, missing seams).
- A new module is introduced during `self-review` and its depth is questionable.
- The codebase has grown and `CONTEXT.md` terms no longer map cleanly to file structure.

### 核心术语

Use these terms exactly in every suggestion:

- **Module** — anything with an interface and an implementation (function, class, package, slice).
- **Interface** — everything a caller must know to use the module: types, invariants, error modes, ordering, config. Not just the type signature.
- **Implementation** — the code inside.
- **Depth** — leverage at the interface: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface. **Deep** = high leverage. **Shallow** = interface nearly as complex as the implementation.
- **Seam** — where an interface lives; a place behaviour can be altered without editing in place.
- **Adapter** — a concrete thing satisfying an interface at a seam.
- **Leverage** — what callers get from depth.
- **Locality** — what maintainers get from depth: change, bugs, knowledge concentrated in one place.

Key principles:

- **Deletion test**: imagine deleting the module. If complexity vanishes, it was a pass-through. If complexity reappears across N callers, it was earning its keep.
- **The interface is the test surface.**
- **One adapter = hypothetical seam. Two adapters = real seam.**

## 可操作流程

### 1. Explore

Read the project's domain glossary (`CONTEXT.md`) and any ADRs in the area you're touching first.

Then explore the codebase organically and note where you experience friction:

- Where does understanding one concept require bouncing between many small modules?
- Where are modules **shallow** — interface nearly as complex as the implementation?
- Where have pure functions been extracted just for testability, but the real bugs hide in how they're called (no **locality**)?
- Where do tightly-coupled modules leak across their seams?
- Which parts of the codebase are untested, or hard to test through their current interface?

Apply the **deletion test** to anything you suspect is shallow.

### 2. Present candidates

Present a numbered list of deepening opportunities. For each candidate:

- **Files** — which files/modules are involved
- **Problem** — why the current architecture is causing friction
- **Solution** — plain English description of what would change
- **Benefits** — explained in terms of locality and leverage, and also in how tests would improve

**Use CONTEXT.md vocabulary for the domain.** If `CONTEXT.md` defines "Order," talk about "the Order intake module" — not "the FooBarHandler."

**ADR conflicts**: if a candidate contradicts an existing ADR, only surface it when the friction is real enough to warrant revisiting the ADR.

Do NOT propose interfaces yet. Ask the user: "Which of these would you like to explore?"

### 3. Grilling loop

Once the user picks a candidate, drop into a grilling conversation. Walk the design tree with them — constraints, dependencies, the shape of the deepened module, what sits behind the seam, what tests survive.

Side effects happen inline:
- **Naming a deepened module after a concept not in CONTEXT.md?** Add the term to `CONTEXT.md`.
- **Sharpening a fuzzy term?** Update `CONTEXT.md` right there.
- **User rejects the candidate with a load-bearing reason?** Offer an ADR so future architecture reviews don't re-suggest it.

### gxpm 集成

- Run `/architecture` once every few days, or after `/diagnose` surfaces an architectural root cause.
- During `self-review`, apply the deletion test to new modules introduced in the PR.
- After `land`, if architecture recommendations were deferred, create a follow-up issue via `gxpm issue create --auto-id`.

## 红旗清单 / 反模式

Do NOT use architecture deepening when:

- The user wants a purely cosmetic rename or formatting change. Use `gxpm-refactor-safely` instead.
- The code is already deep, well-tested, and stable. If the deletion test shows the module earns its keep, leave it alone.
- The change is urgent and tactical (hotfix, security patch). Architecture work is strategic; defer it to a dedicated issue.
- You have not read `CONTEXT.md` and the relevant ADRs. Surfacing architectural friction without domain vocabulary produces shallow advice.

### Counter-examples

**WRONG:** User asks "Can we rename `UserService` to `UserManager`?" You propose a full seam extraction with adapter interfaces.
**RIGHT:** Suggest the rename directly. Architecture skill is for structural depth, not naming preferences.

**WRONG:** A module passes the deletion test (complexity reappears across callers), but you suggest splitting it anyway because it looks large.
**RIGHT:** Size is not depth. A large deep module is preferable to many shallow ones. If deletion test passes, recommend leaving it alone.
